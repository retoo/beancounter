Beancounter

Virtual servers hosted at servers4you.de are being restricted by several
metrics. For example can the system only have a certain amount of open files.
These limitations, the current value of a metric and its limit can be monitored
using a file in /proc/user_beancounters

The beancounter can be used to extract these values regulary and create rrdtool
databases based on the statistics. 

No grahs are being created, the script only creates and updates the .rrd files.
Use another tool as a front end, the tool 'drraw' is recommended:
